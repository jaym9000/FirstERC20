# ERC20 Cryptocurrency

## Overview

This project implements an ERC20 cryptocurrency using Solidity smart contracts. The contract is built on the OpenZeppelin framework, which provides a secure and reliable library of smart contract components. The development process utilizes Foundry, a fast and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard Compliance**: The token adheres to the ERC20 standard, ensuring compatibility with various wallets and exchanges.
- **Security**: Leveraging OpenZeppelin's audited contracts to ensure security and reliability.
- **Modular Development**: Utilizing Foundry for a streamlined development and testing process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) (install via the command line)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jaym9000/FirstERC20.git
   cd jaym9000/FirstERC20
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
make build
```

This command will compile the Solidity contracts and prepare them for deployment.

## Testing

To run the tests for the smart contracts, use:

```bash
make test
```

This will execute the test suite and ensure that all functionalities are working as expected.

## Deployment

To deploy the ERC20 token to a local Ethereum network, use the following command:

```bash
make deploy
```

For deploying to a test network (e.g., Sepolia), you can use:

```bash
make deploy-sepolia
```

Make sure to set the appropriate environment variables in your `.env` file for the RPC URL and private key.

## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the ERC20 token using any Ethereum wallet that supports ERC20 tokens. You can transfer tokens, check balances, and approve allowances as per the ERC20 standard.
